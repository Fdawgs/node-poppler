> Asynchronous node.js wrapper for the Poppler PDF rendering library

## Intro

[Poppler](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/) is a PDF rendering library that also includes a collection of utility binaries, which allows for the manipulation and extraction of data from PDF documents such as converting PDF files to HTML, TXT, or PostScript.

The `node-poppler` module provides an asynchronous node.js wrapper around said utility binaries for easier use.
It was originally created out of a need for a PDF-to-HTML conversion module at [Yeovil District Hospital NHS Foundation Trust](https://yeovilhospital.co.uk/) to convert clinical documents in PDF format to HTML.

## Installation

Install using [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-poppler):

```bash
npm install node-poppler
```

Or [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/node-poppler):

```bash
yarn add node-poppler
```

node-poppler's test scripts use npm commands.

### Linux and macOS/Darwin Support

Windows and macOS/Darwin binaries are provided with this repository.
For Linux users, you will need to download the `poppler-data` and `poppler-utils` binaries separately.

An example of downloading the binaries on a Debian system:

```
sudo apt-get install poppler-data
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils
```

If you do not wish to use the included macOS binaries, you can download the latest versions with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```
brew install poppler
```

Once they have been installed, you will need to pass the `poppler-utils` installation directory in as parameters to an instance of the Poppler class:

```js
const { Poppler } = require("node-poppler");
const poppler = new Poppler("./usr/bin");
```

## API

```js
const { Poppler } = require("node-poppler");
```

[**API Documentation can be found here**](https://github.com/Fdawgs/node-poppler/blob/master/API.md)

## Examples

### poppler.pdfToCairo

Example of an `async` `await` call to poppler.pdfToCairo, to convert only the first and second page of a PDF file to PNG:

```js
const { Poppler } = require("node-poppler");

const file = "test_document.pdf";
const poppler = new Poppler();
const options = {
	firstPageToConvert: 1,
	lastPageToConvert: 2,
	pngFile: true,
};
const outputFile = `test_document.png`;

const res = await poppler.pdfToCairo(file, outputFile, options);
console.log(res);
```

### poppler.pdfToHtml

Example of calling poppler.pdfToHtml with a promise chain:

```js
const { Poppler } = require("node-poppler");

const file = "test_document.pdf";
const poppler = new Poppler();
const options = {
	firstPageToConvert: 1,
	lastPageToConvert: 2,
};

poppler.pdfToHtml(file, options).then((res) => {
	console.log(res);
});
```

### poppler.pdfToText

Example of calling poppler.pdfToText with a promise chain:

```js
const { Poppler } = require("node-poppler");

const file = "test_document.pdf";
const poppler = new Poppler();
const options = {
	firstPageToConvert: 1,
	lastPageToConvert: 2,
};

poppler.pdfToText(file, options).then((res) => {
	console.log(res);
});
```
