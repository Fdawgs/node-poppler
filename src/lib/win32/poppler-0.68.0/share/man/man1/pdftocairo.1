.SH NAME
pdftocairo \- Portable Document Format (PDF) to PNG/JPEG/TIFF/PDF/PS/EPS/SVG using cairo
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pdftocairo
[options]
.IR PDF-file
.RI [ output-file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pdftocairo
converts Portable Document Format (PDF) files, using the cairo output device of the poppler PDF library, to any of the following output formats:
.IP \(bu
Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
.IP \(bu
JPEG Interchange Format (JPEG)
.IP \(bu
Tagged Image File Format (TIFF)
.IP \(bu
Portable Document Format (PDF)
.IP \(bu
PostScript (PS)
.IP \(bu
Encapsulated PostScript (EPS)
.IP \(bu
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
.IP \(bu
Windows Printer
.PP
.B pdftocairo
reads the PDF file,
.IR PDF-file ,
and writes to
.IR output-file .
The image formats (PNG, JPEG, and TIFF) generate one file per page with the page number and file type appended to
.IR output-file .
When \-singlefile is used with the image formats, the file type is appended to
.IR output-file .
When the output format is a vector format (PDF, PS, EPS, and SVG),
.IR output-file
is the full filename.

If the
.IR PDF-file
is \*(lq\-\*(rq , the PDF is read from stdin.
If the
.IR output-file
is \*(lq\-\*(rq , the output file will be written to stdout. Using stdout is not valid with image formats unless \-singlefile is used.
If
.IR output-file
is not used, the output filename will be derived from the
.IR PDF-file
filename.
.PP
Not all options are valid with all output formats. One (and only one) of the output format options (\-png, \-jpeg, \-tiff, \-pdf, \-print, \-ps, \-eps, or \-svg) must be used.
.PP
The resolution options (\-r, \-rx, \-ry) set the resolution of the
image output formats. The image dimensions will depend on the PDF page
size and the resolution. For the vector outputs, regions of the page
that can not be represented natively in the output format (eg
translucency in PS) will be rasterized at the resolution specified by
the resolution options.
.PP
The \-scale-to options may be used to set a fixed image size. The
image resolution will vary with the page size.
.PP
The cropping options (\-x, \-y, \-W, and \-H) use units of pixels with
the image formats and PostScript points (1/72 inch) with the vector
formats. When cropping is used with vector output the cropped region is
centered unless \-nocenter is used in which case the cropped region is
at the top left (SVG) or bottom left (PDF, PS, EPS).

default, these pages are not scaled.

pages larger than the paper are shrunk to fit.
.TP

centered on the paper.  This option causes them to be aligned to the
lower-left corner of the paper instead (PS,PDF,SVG only).

Adds the %%IncludeFeature: *Duplex DuplexNoTumble DSC comment to the
PostScript file (PS only).  This tells the print manager to enable duplexing.

.B WINDOWS PRINTER OPTIONS
for the available options.
.TP
.BI \-setupdlg
(Windows only). When used with \-print, the printer properties dialog is displayed
allowing the print settings to be modified before printing. The paper size selected
in the print properties dialog will be used except when -origpagesizes is specified.

.BI \-opw " password"
Specify the owner password for the PDF file.  Providing this will
bypass all security restrictions.

.SH EXIT CODES
The poppler tools use the following exit codes:
.TP
0
No error.
.TP
1
Error opening a PDF file.
.TP
2
Error opening an output file.
.TP
3
Error related to PDF permissions.
.TP
4
Error related to ICC profile.
.TP
99
Other error.
.SH JPEG OPTIONS
When JPEG output is specified, the \-jpegopt option can be used to control the JPEG compression parameters.
It takes a string of the form "<opt>=<val>[,<opt>=<val>]". Currently the available options are:
.TP
.BI quality
Selects the JPEG quality value. The value must be an integer between 0 and 100.
.TP
.BI progressive
Select progressive JPEG output. The possible values are "y", "n",
indicating progressive (yes) or non-progressive (no), respectively.
.TP
.BI optimize
Sets whether to compute optimal Huffman coding tables for the JPEG output, which
will create smaller files but make an extra pass over the data. The value must
be "y" or "n", with "y" performing optimization, otherwise the default Huffman
tables are used.
.SH WINDOWS PRINTER OPTIONS
In Windows, you can use the \-print option to print directly to a system printer. Additionally, you can use the \-printopt 
option to configure the printer. It takes a string of the form "<opt>=<val>[,<opt>=<val>]". Currently the available options are:
.TP
.BI source
Selects the source paper tray to be used (bin). The possible values are "upper", "onlyone", "lower", "middle", "manual", "envelope",
"envmanual", "auto", "tractor", "smallfmt", "largefmt", "largecapacity", "formsource", or a numeric value to choose a driver specific source.
.TP
.BI duplex
Sets the duplex mode of the printer. The possible values are "off", "short" or "long",
indicating no duplexing, short-edge binding, or long-edge binding, respectively.
General option \-duplex is a synonym of "duplex=long". If both options are specified,
\-printopt has priority.
